hello, suggested query execution plan for your query is as following
step 1:
 perform sequential scan on table demo1 as demo1
 there are 1270 rows returned
step 2:
 from result of step 1, perform sort operation with parent relationship is outer,  parallel aware is false,  sort key is 'demo1.num', 
 there are 1270 rows returned
step 3:
 perform sequential scan on table demo2 as demo2
 there are 1270 rows returned
step 4:
 from result of step 3, perform sort operation with parent relationship is inner,  parallel aware is false,  sort key is 'demo2.num', 
 there are 1270 rows returned
step 5:
 from result of step 2,4, perform merge join operation with parallel aware is false,  join type is inner,  merge cond is demo1.num equal demo2.num, 
 there are 8064 rows returned
