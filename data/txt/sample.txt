hello, suggested query execution plan for your query is as following
step 1:
 perform sequential scan operation with relation demo1 aliased demo1,  parent relationship is outer, 
 there are 1270 rows returned with startup cost 0.0 and total cost 22.7
step 2:
 from result of step 1, perform sort operation with parent relationship is outer,  sort key is 'demo1 num', 
 there are 1270 rows returned with startup cost 88.17 and total cost 91.35
step 3:
 perform sequential scan operation with relation demo2 aliased demo2,  parent relationship is outer, 
 there are 1270 rows returned with startup cost 0.0 and total cost 22.7
step 4:
 from result of step 3, perform sort operation with parent relationship is inner,  sort key is 'demo2 num', 
 there are 1270 rows returned with startup cost 88.17 and total cost 91.35
step 5:
 from result of step 2,4, perform merge join operation with join type is inner,  merge condition is demo1 num equal demo2 num, 
 there are 8064 rows returned with startup cost 176.34 and total cost 303.67
