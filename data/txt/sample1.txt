hello, suggested query execution plan for your query is as following
step 1:
 perform sequential scan operation with relation actor aliased actor,  parent relationship is member, 
 there are 200 rows returned with startup cost 10000000000.0 and total cost 10000000004.0
step 2:
 perform sequential scan operation with relation actor_dup aliased actor_dup,  parent relationship is member, 
 there are 200 rows returned with startup cost 10000000000.0 and total cost 10000000004.0
step 3:
 from result of step 1,2, perform append operation with parent relationship is outer, 
 there are 400 rows returned with startup cost 10000000000.0 and total cost 20000000012.0
step 4:
 from result of step 3, perform aggregate operation with strategy is hashed,  group key is 'actor actor_id', 'actor first_name', 'actor last_name', 'actor last_update', 
 there are 400 rows returned with startup cost 20000000016.0 and total cost 20000000020.0
