hello, suggested query execution plan for your query is as following
step 1:
 perform index only scan operation with relation actor aliased actor_1,  index condition is actor_id is not null,  index name is actor_idx,  parent relationship is outer,  scan direction is forward, 
 there are 200 rows returned with startup cost 0.14 and total cost 16.66
step 2:
 from result of step 1, perform limit operation with parent relationship is initplan,  subplan name is initplan 1 returns 0, 
 there are 1 rows returned with startup cost 0.14 and total cost 0.23
step 3:
 from result of step 2, get value of operation where parent relationship is initplan,  subplan name is initplan 2 returns 1, 
 there are 1 rows returned with startup cost 0.23 and total cost 0.24
step 4:
 from result of step 3, perform sequential scan operation with relation actor aliased actor,  filter is actor_id equal 1, 
 there are 1 rows returned with startup cost 0.24 and total cost 4.74
